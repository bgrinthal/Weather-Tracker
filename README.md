This project built a weather tracker using API's to pull conditions from a weather website.  The tracker is reactive and displays temperature, wind speed, uv index for the current day as well as conditions for the next 5 days when a city is searched.  It will also save and display your city search history allowing you to click on it to display those conditions again.
